# The Argon Programming Language
This is the main repository for Argon language. It contains interpreter and builtins libraries.

# What's Argon
Argon is an interpreted multi-paradigm programming language. Its syntax is influenced by many modern languages and aims to be elegant, clean and simple to use. 

```js
import "enum"
import "io"

let NOBLE_GAS = ["Helium", "Neon", "Argon", "Krypton", "Xenon"]

var group_by_name_length = enum.group_by(len)

NOBLE_GAS
    |> group_by_name_length
    |> io.print

/* {6: [Helium], 4: [Neon], 5: [Argon, Xenon], 7: [Krypton]} */
```

# üöÄ Quick start
The wiki is under development, you can view the current version here: [wiki](https://www.arlang.io/docs/intro)

If you are looking for examples, you can find them here: [examples](https://github.com/ArgonLang/Argon/tree/master/example)

A good way to start could also be to take a look at Argon's built-in modules [here](https://github.com/ArgonLang/Argon/tree/master/arlib)

# üõ†Ô∏è Installing from source

| Platform / Architecture  | x86 | x86_64 | ARM | Apple silicon |
|--------------------------|-----|--------|-----|---------------|
| Windows (7, 8, 10, ...)  | ‚úì   | ‚úì      | ??? | ???           |
| Linux                    | ‚úì   | ‚úì      | ‚úì   | ???           |
| Mac OS                   | NA  | ‚úì      | NA  | ‚úì             |

The Argon build system uses a simple cmake file to build the interpreter.

## Building on Unix-like os

1. Make sure you have installed the following dependences:
  * cmake >= 3.7
  * g++ or clang++
  * GNU make
  * git

2. Clone the sources with git:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ArgonLang/Argon
  cd argon
  ```
  
3. Build:

  ```sh
  cmake .
  make
  ```
  
When completed, Argon and related libraries will placed in `bin/` directory.

N.B: At present there are no installation steps.

## Building on Windows
Building Argon on Windows environment requires Visual Studio, or the Microsoft Build Tools. 
You can download and install the tool of your choice from the [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) page.

1. Install Visual Studio / Microsoft Build Tools.
2. From Windows start menu, open **Developer Command Prompt** and go to the Argon root folder:
```sh
    cd %path_of_Argon_folder%
```
3. Execute `build.bat` to start compilation.

If you preferred to install Visual Studio, you can import the CMake project directly into visual studio. 
To do this, open Visual Studio and press **continue without code** in the welcome window that opens before the IDE. 
From IDE menu, select File > Open > CMake... and open the CMakeLists.txt file, ignore the CMake Overview Page that might open 
and from the top bar select Argon.exe as start up item, select the configuration of interest (Debug / Release) and start the compilation 
through the play button(or press F5 key).

‚ö†Ô∏è Tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

# ‚ÄºÔ∏è Notes
Argon is under active development, so many features are not yet active or available, a list (certainly not exhaustive) of the missing features is the following:
* No debugging support.
* Currently, all test cases are disabled ~~and out of date~~.

# The Argon Programming Language
This is the main repository for Argon language. It contains interpreter and builtins libraries.

# What's Argon
Argon is an interpreted multi-paradigm programming language. Its syntax is influenced by Python, Go and Rust, it is neat, simple to use and easily extensible. 

# üöÄ Quick start
The wiki is under development, you can view the current version here: [wiki](https://github.com/jacopodl/Argon/wiki)

# üõ†Ô∏è Installing from source

| Platform / Architecture  | x86 | x86_64 | ARM | Apple silicon |
